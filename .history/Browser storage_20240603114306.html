    <!-- When building web applications, you’ll often need to store data on
the browser for various purposes like caching (storing data locally to
improve performance), storing user preferences, or storing user data
for easy retrieval. -->

    <!-- Cookies
    Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on a user’s computer
    by the web browser. They were designed to be a reliable mechanism
    for websites to remember stateful information (such as items added
    to the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user’s
    browsing activity and store small amounts of data that could be used
    to persist information between page requests -->

    <!-- Cookies are typically stored in key-value pairs, and each cookie is
associated with a specific domain. So a website can only access
cookies it has set. Cookies are also limited in size, and can only store
a maximum of 4KB of data. They can be set to expire at a specific
time, after which they will be deleted by the browser -->

    <!-- Storing Data in Cookies -->
        <!-- We can set a cookie using the document.cookie
    property -->
