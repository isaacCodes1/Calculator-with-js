    <!-- When building web applications, you’ll often need to store data on
the browser for various purposes like caching (storing data locally to
improve performance), storing user preferences, or storing user data
for easy retrieval. -->

    <!-- Cookies
    Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on a user’s computer
    by the web browser. They were designed to be a reliable mechanism
    for websites to remember stateful information (such as items added
    to the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user’s
    browsing activity and store small amounts of data that could be used
    to persist information between page requests -->
