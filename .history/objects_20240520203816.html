            lastName : "Isaac",

    //The HTML DOM (Document Object Model)
    // When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
    // The DOM can be used to even manipulate HTMl elements in the webpage, sometimes the "M", in the DOM is often called Manipulation.
    // The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

    // The webpage is also called a document, it can be manipulated using the document attribute.

    document.title = "DOM manipulation with Javascript"; // This will change whatever the title of this website will be, even if it has already been called in the HTML. This way will not work for other elements, therefore, the getElementById id the most acceptable, as shown below-----
    document.getElementById("title").innerHTML = "DOM manipulation with Javascript!!!!!"; // This will change whatever the title of this. This way is best to change or manipulate HTML elements in JavaScript.


    //A node is a point in the webpage that contains a specific data.
    ///If you look at the HTML elements above, the !DOCTYPE element is a parent node holding no child.
    // The html element is a parent node having two children node, the head nd body elements.
    // The head element is a parent node having three children node, the two meta element and the title element.
    //The body element is also a parent node housing the aside element, the section, the article, and the script element.
    //The aside element is also a parent node having two children the section and the article element.
    //The section element is a parent node having three children, the article element, the h1 element and the p element.

    //All these elements can be easily manipulated with JavaScript.

    //The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).

    // In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.

    // The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.

    // A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).

    // A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).


    //The innerHTML element and getElementById method;

    //The innerHTML method is a property of a DOM element in JavaScript that allows you to get or set the HTML content inside that element. When you use the innerHTML property to get the content, it returns the HTML content inside the element as a string. When you use it to set the content, you can replace the existing content with new HTML content.

    //Examples:
    //1.) 
    document.getElementById("hello").innerHTML= "Hello World!";  // We successfully went into the HTML and fetched the id "hello", and gave it a child node "Hello World!"

    //2.)

    document.getElementById("hi").innerHTML= "Hi Everyone!";  // We successfully went into the HTML and fetched the id "hi", and gave it a child node "Hi Everyone!"


    // The getElementByClass method
    //The getElementByTag method

    //Concatenating getElementById method

    const element = document.getElementById("qualifications");

    document.getElementById("qualifications").innerHTML = "My name is Oladimeji Isaac, Here are my Qualifications:" + " " + element.innerHTML;


    //QuerySelector All methods

    const text = document.querySelectorAll("text");
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Do you want to know what I love?" + " " + document.getElementById("text").innerHTML;    




    // We can also use the innerHTML property to modify the HTML content
    // of an element. Let’s add a p element with the text “The DOM is
    // awesome!” to the body element:
    document.body.innerHTML += '<p>The DOM is awesome!</p>';
    // Notice that we’re appending the new HTML content with the +=
    // operator instead of reassigning the value of the innerHTML property. 



    //FUNCTIONS REVISION.

    //                                       THINGS TO NOTE!!
    // • A function is a set of statements designed to perform a
    // particular task.
    // • During a function definition, the names representing the values we intend to supply to the function are called parameters.
    // • During a function call, the actual values provided to the
    // function are called arguments.
    // • We can use up to 255 parameters in a function definition.
    // • An anonymous function is a function that does not have a
    // name, and to reuse an anonymous function, we have to assign
    // it to a variable.
    // • An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that is invoked immediately after it is declared.
    // • A function should have only one responsibility.
    // • Function names should be descriptive, straight to the point and
    // timeless.



    //JavaScript String Methods.

    // trim()

    
    // The trim() method removes whitespace from the beginning and end
    // of a string:
    let messages = ' Hello World ';
    console.log(messages.trim())
    // output: Hello World
    // One important concept to understand is that these methods are
    // chainable, meaning that you can call one method after another on the
    // same string to perform multiple operations in a single line of code.
    // Let’s try an example that demonstrates chaining multiple built-in
    // methods to manipulate a string:
    let message = ' Hello World '
    console.log(message.trim().toUpperCase())
    // output: HELLO WORLD
    // In the example above, we first call the trim() method on the message
    // variable to remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of the
    // string. Then we call the toUpperCase() method on the result of the
    // trim() method to convert the string to uppercase.
